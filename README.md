# README - Lunar-Lander-javafx #

A simple spacecraft landing game created with javaFX using a custom-built game engine to allow making games using JavaFX.

***
## Game Controls:

+ Keyboard controls to make each vehicle move up, to the left and right.
+ The user will have to use the gravity to bring the vehicle down, using proper timing to bring it down at the right time and speed.

## Game Elements:

+ Simple gravity physics that accelerate different objects at different rates based on their weight.
+ Static levels each with a simple vertical maze that the player has to navigate.
+ Two different levels.
+ Different vehicles available for use in different levels.
+ The player will lose health points if they touch any surface that isn't a powerup or a landing pad.
+ The player will lose health points if they go out of bounds of the screen.
+ The player will lose the game if their health points reach 0.
+ A powerup exists in the second level that increments the player's health points if they come into contact with it.

## How to Win:

+ Use the keyboard to control upward and left/right thrusters to move the craft.
+ Use gravity to bring the spacecraft down, but use the thrusters to ensure that you don't fall too fast.
+ Don't touch any walls or go out of bounds.
